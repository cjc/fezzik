Fezzik is a bulk file renamer that uses your text editor of choice to present an entire directory of filenames to you for easy editing. When the text editor is closed (and the file saved), it will act upon the changes you have made.

Once set up, the basic use of Fezzik goes: 

1. Right click on the folder containing the files to rename, select Rename files with Fezzik 
1. This opens your preferred text editor (chosen in setup) with a text file containing the folder's directory listing. 
1. You make changes to the filenames in the text file. 
1. Save and close the text editor and Fezzik will action the changes.
